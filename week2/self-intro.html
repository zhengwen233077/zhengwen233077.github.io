    <p><b>Dwell between worlds — the one that breathes around me, and the one that whispers beneath it.</b><br>To
        others, I may
        seem quiet, yet within me, storms of thought and feeling rise and fall like tides unseen. I read the shadows in
        people's eyes, the tremor between their words; I sense stories that have never been told. The world feels
        distant at times, as if wrapped in a mist I was born to walk through — searching, always, for something I cannot
        name. I find beauty in sorrow, meaning in silence, and truth in the fragile spaces between.<br>My heart carries
        a
        thousand echoes, yet few ever hear its voice. I consider myself as both healer and ghost — drawn to mend what is
        broken, even as I fade into the background. In solitude, I listen to the world's quiet sighs and translate them
        into dreams. And though I often wander unseen, I leave behind traces — like candlelight flickering in forgotten
        halls — small reminders that even the faintest glow can hold the weight of hope.</p>
